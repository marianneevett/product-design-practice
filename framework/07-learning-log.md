# Learning Log

A learning log captures what happened after a product decision, feature, or experiment reached the real world.

It connects what we expected to happen with what actually happened.

The goal is not to produce a postmortem for every release.

The goal is to preserve useful evidence so future decisions can build on what was learned instead of starting from memory.

## Feature / initiative

### [Name]

**Status:** Monitoring / Learned / Revisit
**Shipped:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Related feature definition:**
**Related decision(s):**

---

## What changed

What was introduced, removed, or materially changed?

Keep this concise.

*

---

## What we expected

What did we believe would happen?

Include the assumptions, hypotheses, or intended outcomes behind the work.

*

---

## Why we expected it

What evidence or reasoning supported those expectations?

This might include:

* Research

* Behavioral data

* Customer feedback

* Previous experiments

* Product principles

* Business needs

* Comparable product behavior

* Team judgment

*

---

## What happened

What do we know now?

Separate observations from interpretation where possible.

### Observations

*

### Evidence

*

Evidence might include:

* Usage behavior
* Funnel changes
* Support themes
* Customer feedback
* Qualitative research
* Operational impact
* Performance
* Errors
* Business outcomes

---

## Expected vs. observed

| We expected | We observed |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|             |             |
|             |             |

This comparison is often more useful than evaluating whether a feature was simply a success or failure.

---

## What surprised us

What happened that we did not anticipate?

*

Unexpected behavior is often where the most useful learning lives.

---

## What became clearer

What do we understand better now?

Consider:

* Customer behavior

* Product rules

* System constraints

* Operational realities

* Business assumptions

* Experience principles

* Technical limitations

*

---

## What remains unclear

What questions still don't have enough evidence?

*

Avoid turning uncertainty into a conclusion simply because the work has shipped.

---

## Product implications

What should change because of what we learned?

### Keep

What appears to be working and should remain?

*

### Improve

What should be adjusted?

*

### Remove

What no longer appears useful or justified?

*

### Explore

What deserves further investigation?

*

## Decisions affected

Does this learning reinforce, challenge, or invalidate an existing product decision?

| Decision | Impact                             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
|          | Reinforces / Challenges / Replaces |
|          | Reinforces / Challenges / Replaces |

If a previous decision changes, update its status in the decision log rather than rewriting history.

---

## Principles affected

Does this learning change how we understand any experience principle?

*

Principles should evolve when evidence changes the reasoning behind them.

---

## Follow-up

What should happen next?

* [ ]
* [ ]
* [ ]

Not every learning needs to produce immediate work.

Sometimes the right action is simply to preserve the evidence until another decision depends on it.

---

## Revisit when

When should this learning be reviewed again?

Examples:

* More usage data exists

* A related feature ships

* Customer behavior changes

* A business rule changes

* A new research study is completed

* The same problem appears elsewhere in the product

*

---

## Closing the loop

Shipping is not the final step in the design process.

A product creates new evidence once people begin using it.

That evidence should be able to move backward through the system:

```text
implementation
      ↓
real behavior
      ↓
learning
      ↓
new understanding
      ↓
better decisions
      ↓
next iteration
```

The objective is not to prove that the original decision was correct.

**The objective is to make the next decision better informed than the last one.**
